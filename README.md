# Getting-Started

A collection of documentation describing how a new member joining the team should install.

Robot Operating System (ROS) is a programming paradim that allows for easy communication between different computers on the same network. For the AUVSI SUAS competition ROS is used for communication between the different hardware and software systems. 

The best way to develop in ROS is to use a linux operating system. Currently ubuntu 20.04 is the standard for the Club as it has python3 by default. Most members either have access to a seprate linux machine or dual boot their laptops. Since dual booting is machine specific this guide does not much detail. If you need more specific help reach out to a club officer.
